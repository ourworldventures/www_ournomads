To power OurWorld Digital Nomad DAO, we will create a Digital Nomad Token (DNT) which will act as a proof of co-ownership â€“ providing token holders the following benefits:

- A seat in the OurWorld Digital Nomad governance system, overseeing the further developments of the community and its ecosystem

- Yield on future rental of properties and related infrastructure (energy, food, internet generation)
- Preferential access to homes, events and retreats in all locations
- Priority access to organic food reserves and internet capacity
- Ability to reserve premises/locations for private events
