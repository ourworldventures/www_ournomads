### JUNGLE PARADISE 

RESORT IN ZANZIBAR, TANZANIA

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Jungle Paradise is based at Mbweni in Zanzibar and is home to a boutique hotel, botanical gardens and ruins with a rich history. The location was instrumental in abolishing slavery and had a school where mainly slave children had a chance to get educated and become free. The ruins are surrounded by a beautiful botanic garden which supports over 600 different kinds of tree species. It has a mature rainforest atmosphere, only found in a few other places in Zanzibar and Pemba. It has many areas of native plants, including the coral rag forest on the cliff and mangroves on the shoreline.

This location in the capital is ideal for digital nomads as they have quick access to Zanzibar's business district and airport, while being in a remote and peaceful neighbourhood.

### YENICE VALLEY
RESORT IN MUGLA, TURKEY

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The concept of Yenice Valle grew from a love of traditional Turkish village life and the desire to sustain our natural environment. Yenice Valley has come to reality in a secluded valley, surrounded by tree-covered mountains, with accommodation built using traditional local materials, to include a treehouse, stone cottages, and a log cabin, each in plenty of space, well-furnished and fully equipped. The focal point is a stunning stone-built boutique hotel, which fits perfectly with the surrounding countryside.

### CITY OF PEACE
RESORT IN DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
We have a unique opportunity to acquire 2 million square metres of beachfront land just south of Dar-es-Salaam and turn it into a new home for digital nomads. The plot is 30km south-east of Dar-es-Salaam. It provides a refuge for digital nomads who wish to be away from city life and a staging point for those who want to visit the famous Serengeti National Park or Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Manyara, Sealous Game Reserve and Zanzibar. However, it is not unreasonably far from the business hub of Dar-es-Salaam and the airport.
<p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
There are 32 hectares of built-up land in the plot, consisting of 10 bungalows with thatched roofs. These bungalows have Wi-Fi, TVs, living areas, safes, tea & coffeemaking facilities and they all have terraces with ocean views.

### FARMS
MULTIPLE LANDS IN TANZANIA

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Located in the middle of Lake Victoria, Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania has one of Africa's most fertile lands. The farm lands in Tanzania are significantly cheaper than lands in Zanzibar. We aim to acquire up to 500 hectares of land in mainland Tanzania. This acquisition will be done in phases based on the priorities of the project at the time.
<p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Up to 50 hectares of land is planned to be acquired. Our team is still scouting for more farmlands across the Zanzibar archipelago. Many pieces of land are identified and we are in contact with the relevant authorities for further steps. Even though the identified farming lands are in many locations in Zanzibar, we plan to acquire a majority of the land from Bambi in Unguja Island and Pemba Island. The first land in Bambi has already been purchased.
